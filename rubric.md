| Compelling: is it 'truthful'     | Does not engage with the secondary literature and scholarship                               | A minimal engagement                                                   | A basic awareness with the standard secondary literature and scholarship | Engages with the secondary literature in meaningful ways                                          | Engages with the secondary literature in insightful ways, advances novel perspectives on this material                                      | /4     |
